## What is Technical Debt?

Technical debt refers to the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. In our project, we track technical debt to ensure code quality and maintainability over time.

## High Priority Technical Debt

_No high-priority technical debt items currently identified._

---

## Medium Priority Technical Debt

_No medium-priority technical debt items currently identified._

---

## Low Priority Technical Debt

_No low-priority technical debt items currently identified._

## Technical Debt Template

When adding technical debt items, use this format:

### [Priority] - [Component/Area] - [Brief Description]

**Priority**: High / Medium / Low  
**Type**: Architecture / Code Quality / Performance / Security / Testing  
**Estimated Effort**: Small / Medium / Large  
**Impact**: High / Medium / Low  
**Added**: [Date]  
**Assigned**: [Developer Name]

#### Current Situation

[Description of current implementation and why it's considered technical debt]

#### Proposed Solution

[How we should improve this]

#### Benefits of Fixing

- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]
- [Benefit 3]

#### Risks of Not Fixing

- [Risk 1]
- [Risk 2]

## Review and Prioritization

### Monthly Technical Debt Review

1. **Assessment**: Review all active technical debt items
2. **Prioritization**: Update priorities based on current project needs
3. **Planning**: Allocate time in upcoming sprints for debt reduction
4. **Assignment**: Assign items to team members
5. **Tracking**: Monitor progress and completion

### Prioritization Criteria

#### High Priority

- Blocks new feature development
- Causes frequent bugs or issues
- Significant performance impact
- Security vulnerabilities
- Makes code difficult to maintain

#### Medium Priority

- Slows down development
- Occasional issues or workarounds needed
- Moderate performance impact
- Code quality concerns
- Future scalability issues

#### Low Priority

- Minor convenience improvements
- Code style inconsistencies
- Nice-to-have optimizations
- Documentation improvements
- Future-proofing measures

## Metrics and Tracking

### Debt Accumulation

- **New Debt Added**: Track when technical debt is introduced
- **Debt Resolved**: Track when debt items are addressed
- **Net Debt Change**: Monthly change in total technical debt

### Code Quality Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: Maintain >80% test coverage
- **Linting Violations**: Keep under 10 warnings
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor and optimize
- **Performance Scores**: Lighthouse metrics

### Developer Experience

- **Build Time**: Keep under 30 seconds
- **Development Setup**: New developer onboarding time
- **Code Review Time**: Average time for PR reviews
- **Bug Resolution**: Time from bug report to fix

---

## Prevention Strategies

### Code Review Guidelines

- Watch for quick fixes that introduce debt
- Ensure proper testing before merging
- Check for code duplication
- Verify documentation updates

### Development Practices

- **Definition of Done**: Include technical debt assessment
- **Refactoring Time**: Allocate 20% of sprint time for improvements
- **Architecture Reviews**: Regular architecture discussions
- **Learning Sessions**: Share knowledge about best practices

### Automated Checks

- ESLint for code quality
- Bundle analyzer for performance monitoring
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

---

## Debt Reduction Goals

### Short Term (1-2 Sprints)

- Maintain zero high-priority technical debt
- Address new debt items within 30 days
- Keep code coverage above 80%

### Medium Term (3-6 Months)

- Reduce total technical debt by 50%
- Implement comprehensive testing strategy
- Establish automated quality gates

### Long Term (6+ Months)

- Achieve sustainable development velocity
- Maintain high code quality standards
- Build robust architecture for scaling

## Contributing to Debt Reduction

### How to Help

1. **Identify Issues**: Report technical debt when you encounter it
2. **Propose Solutions**: Suggest improvements in your areas of expertise
3. **Take Ownership**: Volunteer to address debt items
4. **Share Knowledge**: Help others understand best practices

### Best Practices

- Include debt reduction in regular development work
- Don't ignore small improvements - they add up
- Communicate about architectural decisions
- Test thoroughly when refactoring

_Remember: A little technical debt is normal and sometimes necessary for rapid development. The key is to manage it consciously and address it regularly._
